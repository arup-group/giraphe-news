We recently took some time out to host the webinar, [**Oasys Giraphe: Harnessing the power of the cloud with dynamic geotechnical data visualisation and interpretation**](https://www.oasys-software.com/webinars/oasys-giraphe-harnessing-the-power-of-the-cloud-with-dynamic-geotechnical-data-visualisation-and-interpretation/) on the 17th of July, 2024 at 12:00 (GMT +1). This was a great opportunity for the Oasys Giraphe team to showcase the **transformative and dynamic graphing capabilities** of our newest solution. We enjoyed the chance to demonstrate how Giraphe and OpenGround work together to improve your workflow within geotechnical data management, visualisation and interpretation. You can [**watch the webinar**]( https://youtu.be/czROb8vJ0u0) on our website. 

Learn about **Arup’s journey from gINT** to OpenGround and some key cloud computing advantages we have leveraged in that transition. One of the many advantages of Giraphe has ultimately been enabling Arup engineers to speed up projects by:  

•	Simplifying data mining processes with smart queries,  

•	Offering dynamic and interactive graphing,  

•	Enabling you to do more work in less time through efficiencies in data refreshment and reporting, including high quality graphics. 

For those of you who are already getting to know Giraphe, you will appreciate seeing our latest developments in action and our demonstration of simultaneous **graph creation from multiple templates** in our ever-growing graph template library. We have also added the ability to **display trend lines** on your graphs and include them in the report ready exports. And finally, we reveal some features to come: **collaboration, sharing, and advanced graphical filtering**. 

We enjoyed hearing from you and having the chance to answer your questions! We develop Giraphe with our users in mind and user feedback and insights remain a key focus in our development process. We look forward to the next time we hear from you and can share the next capabilities and features in Giraphe.
