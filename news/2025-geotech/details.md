We were at [**Ground Engineeringâ€™s GeoTech 2025 Conference**](https://geotech.geplus.co.uk/2025/en/page/home)!

It was the perfect forum for us to showcase our latest software and to make and re-make connections within the Ground Engineering industry.

As a sponsor, we were delighted to have the opportunity to present at the conference. Alongside the conversations at our exhibition stand, we thoroughly enjoyed discussing software, technology and innovation in Ground Engineering with conference attendees.

We look forward to seeing you at future conferences. Do keep an eye out for news posts on where you can find us next!
