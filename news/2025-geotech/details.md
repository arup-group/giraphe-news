Oasys are very proud to be a sponsor of [**Ground Engineering’s Geotech 2025 Conference**](https://geotech.geplus.co.uk/2025/en/page/home). Having previously exhibited at Smart Geotechnics in 2023 and 2024, we cannot wait to play our part in this expanded iteration of the conference. 

Focusing on all things new, innovative and transformative in Ground Engineering, we believe it’s the perfect forum for us to showcase our latest software and to make and re-make connections within the Ground Engineering industry.

As a sponsor we are delighted to have the opportunity to present at the conference. Alongside the conversations at our exhibition stand, we hope that by presenting we will have even more opportunities to discuss software, technology and innovation in Ground Engineering with conference attendees.

We look forward to seeing you at Geotech 2025, and we hope to speak with as many people as possible before, during and after the conference. Please do come and connect with us either around the presentation, at our exhibition space, or in the run up to and after the event.
