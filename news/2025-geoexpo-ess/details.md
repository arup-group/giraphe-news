We're delighted to announce that we will be attending the [**GEO (Geotechnical Engineering & Operations) Expo**](https://www.ess-expo.co.uk/geo) at ESS 2025!

Come speak with us on the 17th and 18th of September! We would love to hear about your experience with **Oasys Giraphe**, and will also be showcasing **Oasys Gofer** and our [**Oasys Geotechnical product portfolio**](https://www.oasys-software.com/products/geotechnical-suite/).

It will be really exciting to have more conversations about ground engineering applications together. We can't wait to demonstrate the latest updates from **Oasys Giraphe** and learn what features you're looking forward to. 

We hope to see you there!
