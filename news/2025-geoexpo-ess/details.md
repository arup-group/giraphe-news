We're delighted to announce that we will be attending the [**GEO (Geotechnical Engineering & Operations) Expo**](https://www.ess-expo.co.uk/geo) at ESS 2025!

Come speak with us on the 17th and 18th of September. We would love to hear about your experience with **Giraphe**, and share the new features the software in our geotechnical suite have to offer!

It will be really exciting to have more conversations about ground engineering tools together. We can't wait to demonstrate the latest updates from our [**Oasys Geotechnical product portfolio**](https://www.oasys-software.com/products/geotechnical-suite/), and learn what features you're looking forward to. 

We hope to see you there!
