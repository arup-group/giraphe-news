We were at Geo Expo 2025!

We were delighted to attend the [**GEO (Geotechnical Engineering & Operations) Expo**](https://www.ess-expo.co.uk/geo) at ESS 2025!

Thanks to everyone that came to speak with us, we had some fantastic conversations and enjoyed showcasing Oasys Giraphe, Oasys Gofer, and the geotechnical product portfolio.
