In recent months, Giraphe has evolved to reflect both the ambition of its development team and the changing needs of its users. The latest updates mark significant progress in how Giraphe enables geotechnical professionals to create, manage, and interact with their data through powerful, flexible graphing tools.

## Empowering users with control and flexibility
One of the most impactful changes has been the introduction of **editable datasets**. This feature allows users to adjust or redefine their datasets within Giraphe, for example, by adding or removing fields, or applying filters to tailor queries. While the core data continues to be managed in OpenGround, this new flexibility means users can now adapt their datasets to suit specific graphing requirements, improving on the previous, more rigid approach.

Complementing this, the ability to **export datasets to CSV** has opened up new possibilities for data manipulation. Users can now easily export data, augment it - for example with further calculations - and re-import the enhanced dataset for onward use in Giraphe. This streamlines processes that previously required the use of several different datasets.

## Smarter, more intuitive graphing
Giraphe’s graphing capabilities have advanced significantly. The addition of **statistically generated trendlines on datetime graphs**, now available on both datetime and numerical graphs, helps users visualise trends more quickly and make data-driven decisions with greater confidence. This improvement will be especially valuable for those working with geo-environmental or monitoring datasets. 

The introduction of **pan and zoom controls** in the graphical view brings a major usability upgrade. Navigating graphs is now smoother and more intuitive, allowing users to focus on insights rather than interface limitations.

## Streamlined outputs and enhanced communication
Recognising how important graph outputs are in professional reporting, Giraphe now allows users to **copy graphs directly to their clipboard as PNG images**. This simple yet powerful feature eliminates compatibility issues with SVG files in common applications like Microsoft Word, making it easier to embed graphs seamlessly into reports and presentations.

Perhaps most notably, the long-awaited **PDF export capability** has arrived. This frequently requested feature positions Giraphe as a more complete solution for professional documentation. Users can now download either a zip folder containing separate PDF files for each graph or a single, multi-page PDF encompassing the entire export. Alongside this, the team has begun refining export layouts to ensure visual consistency and a higher presentation standard - laying the groundwork for future design enhancements.

## Getting to the point on larger projects
Giraphe’s new ability to **pre-select location groups and geology codes** is particularly valuable for large-scale OpenGround projects. Users can now target relevant data subsets by pre-selecting specific combinations when creating graphs. This not only speeds up graph production by requesting less data but also reduces manual steps, helping users generate the graphs they need more efficiently.

## Keeping you informed and engaged
Beyond technical updates, Giraphe now includes **in-app news and downtime alerts**. Users are notified of important updates and system status changes directly within the application, fostering greater transparency and a stronger connection between the development team and the user community.

## Looking ahead
Feedback from users and industry events has been overwhelmingly positive, with many reporting that Giraphe now enables them to create sophisticated graphs in minutes rather than hours. The emphasis on automation, customisation, and seamless integration continues to resonate with professionals who need to deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines.

As Giraphe continues to evolve, the focus remains on empowering users with tools that help them work smarter, communicate more effectively, and unlock deeper insights from their data. These updates are not just incremental improvements—they represent a step toward a future where geotechnical graphing is faster, easier, and more impactful than ever before.
