In October, our very own Mark Skinner, Oasys Geotechnical Portfolio Product Manager, joined Roger Chandler, Seequent Director of Geotechnical Information Management in presenting the webinar, [*Leveraging cloud technology: Integrating dynamic geotechnical graphing within your workflow*](https://emap-publishing.formstack.com/forms/ge_sequeent_webinar_26_oct_2023). Hosted by Ground Engineering Magazine (sponsored by Seequent), this was a great opportunity to talk to you and answer your questions about this important topic. 

## The journey to the cloud

As Mark explained, since starting to transition to OpenGround, Seequent’s cloud-based geotechnical information management application, Arup has been revieweing more than 200 existing gINT graph templates. We needed to retain that functionality moving forward and wanted something that would be available not just inside of Arup.  Oasys Giraphe aims to expand access to a broader audience than just those who have the technical expertise to create their own connections to the OpenGround API. 

Through our technology partnership with Seequent, we were able to develop Oasys Giraphe as an innovative solution to take advantage of the opportunity to automate and produce truly dynamic graphs. With its integration to OpenGround, Giraphe offers the ability to graph data and make it possible to better understand and interpret that data in a report-ready format. 

## Introducing Giraphe

So how does it work? As Mark demonstrated during the webinar, it all starts with Giraphe’s collections. Collections are the foundation for your graphs in Giraphe because this is where your projects are selected, your datasets are defined, and exports become possible. 

Collections contain graphs and datasets that are associated with a particular project, settings allow for OpenGround default project for adding more graphs in future. 
You can start the process of building graphs by selecting a project  in OpenGround and making this project the default for your collection, or you can upload your own data in a .CSV headed table.

After selecting a project in OpenGround, you can create a dataset, use a template from Girpahe’s graph library or build a custom graph. Creating the dataset or selecting a template triggers the process of copying the necessary data for your graph or dataset into Giraphe, creating a snapshot if you will, to allow for self-contained graphs.

Look out for our interactive graphing features. Use your mouse to highlight, for example, geology or key elements as you explore the data. You can query OpenGround and Giraphe will pick up all of the fields in your selected project. You can then filter between all fields or define the data for your datasets as needed. Add a series by selecting a dataset and assigning those values to your axes, you can also select and assign colours, for example, to differentiate geology codes.  

Select the graphs from the collection that you want to export.  All exports are in scalable file formats ready for pasting into your reports without importing or scaling issues.

## Giraphe and OpenGround

You can have OpenGround and Giraphe open at the same time and toggle between them, for example, on separate screens. Refresh your graph and see the updated results instantly. When your data updates, number of bore holes increases, or draft data becomes final data, similarly update and refresh the graph. No additional effort is required.

‘This will save you a lot of time,’ Mark said, drawing upon his own experience as a geotechnical engineer who has done this kind of graphing. ‘Interpret your data and update values without having to rebuild your graph – dynamic graphing means you can update the existing dataset and graph with just a few clicks (takes only seconds to do).’ Once completed, Giraphe will continue to grow its graph libraries and will continue to expand its offerings for data visualisations that refresh at the click of a button. 

This seamless integration with OpenGround leverages the power of cloud computing and builds upon the significance of the data being centrally available. But more than that, Giraphe is part of the modernisation of geotechnical workflows so will save you time over working in data tables, reducing inconsistencies with graphing in reports across your entire organisation.
