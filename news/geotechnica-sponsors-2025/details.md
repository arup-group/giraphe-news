We really enjoyed being at [**Geotechnica** 2025](https://www.equipegroup.com/geotechnica/about). We spoke to lots of you from across the geotechnical community and beyond - great to reconnect with colleagues from the industry. But also a wonderful chance to meet with some longstanding users of our software – and to make new connections! 

We got the chance to demonstrate **Oasys Gofer** and **Giraphe** to many of you and it was a real pleasure engaging in conversations with about how our software can be useful to you. We learned a thing or two about what you would like to see Gofer and Giraphe do next too! 

We were even part of the presentations with Arup’s Ben Gilson featuring Gofer and Giraphe in his talk about the future of technology in geotechnics.  

It is great to see the excitement building for our [**Oasys Geotechnical product portfolio**](https://www.oasys-software.com/products/geotechnical-suite/) and to learn from you how Gofer and Giraphe are helping to make your everyday geotechnical work even easier.
