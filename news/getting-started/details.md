Giraphe is the latest cloud-based solution from Oasys. Smart, powerful, and user-friendly: welcome to geotechnical graphing for the digital age. Produced in partnership with Seequent, Giraphe takes the hard work out of graphing, communicating seamlessly with OpenGround data and automatically saving your creations. Create, refresh and export report-ready graphs from wherever you have an internet connection. 

## What’s in a name? 

It’s not too much of a stretch to spot the similarities between graph, and Giraphe, but did you know that like our symbiotic namesake, our software is also designed to help things come together? Be it the latest project data or display options you need for your geotechnical reports. Here’s a brief introduction to some of the key features you’ll find in Giraphe, and how to use them. 

## Collections 

It all begins with a Collection. This is where your project data and graphs are stored. Create a new one in just a few clicks. You can return to edit your collection name and description at any time and once you’ve hit Create, you’ll be able to start building your graphs. 

## Graphs: Blank or template 

Whether you’re working with in situ or lab results; geo-environmental or monitoring data, Giraphe’s graph library allows you to choose from a range of ready-made graph templates or build your own blank graph with our flexible display options.  

## OpenGround 

Giraphe works in-sync with OpenGround project data to provide you with a seamless, synchronised flow of information for your graphs. To build your graphs, simply choose from the OpenGround clouds and projects you have access to.  You can also refresh graphs to reflect changes in OpenGround, or as you start to interpret your data so that your graphs are ready to export and share. 

## Datasets 

Collection graphs are populated using data saved in Giraphe datasets. These can be uploaded from a CSV file, pulled from an OpenGround project using a template graph, or created as a custom dataset customised using Giraphe’s  query builder.  

## Exports 

You’ve created your collection, populated it with datasets and customised your graphs: now share your creation with colleagues, clients, or collaborators. Giraphe allows you to export graphs as an SVG file individually, or as a batch.  

However you choose to bring your graphs to life, Giraphe’s series of tutorials and documentation, will help guide you every step of the way.
