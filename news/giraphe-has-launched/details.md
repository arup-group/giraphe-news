The Oasys Giraphe team has been riding high on the excitement of longer days and the launch of Giraphe! 

After completing a round of user interviews and tests at the end of last year, your enthusiasm and shared feedback has carried us into the new year with pride and purpose. As we worked through the grey days of January, we applied our efforts to improving and expanding Giraphe, keen to deliver **responsive solutions for our users**.

We’re pleased with the progress made so far, and think you’ll agree! 

Giraphe’s navigation has been refined so that you can find and **search elements more quickly and easily**. We’ve added short descriptions to help guide you through and breadcrumb navigation at the top to help you find your way.

We have **added more graphing templates** to our library, including our first time-based options. You may notice the library layout has also been refreshed to display templates in tile format, making it even easier for you to find what you’re looking for.  Giraphe now **shows you the fields that will be sampled from OpenGround**, whether those fields are present in your project and providing a warning if any are missing. These enhancements support a better overview of the connections between data held in OpenGround and graphing options in Giraphe. 

**Exports are now report-ready**, allowing you to show a report name, client name and other information, with additional guidance and explanations on how to use them. 

To support these evolving capabilities, we’ve **expanded our tutorial library** too. You will now find even better guidance and explanations on how to use Giraphe as well as new videos in our Learn tab.

Something not quite right? Our **support tickets are improved** too! You can now attach your graph to the ticket to get you to a solution even faster. 

Word is getting around with links from **our Partners at** [**Seequent**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/seequent/) and friends and colleagues on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7157656595944865792).
