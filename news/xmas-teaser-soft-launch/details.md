Just in time for the holiday season, our elves have wonderful things coming out of the Oasys Giraphe workshop. We know you will be excited about what Giraphe can do!

Get ready to **modernise your geotechnical workflows**. You'll get more consistent graphing in reports across your entire organisation! We partnered with Seequent to leverage the power of the cloud with **seamless integration to OpenGround**.

We have just **updated the legend** so that you can expand it when you have lots of items to view. Plus, there is a **new information box** on each graph in Giraphe's library, providing you with details about the OpenGround database fields Giraphe queries to generate that template and whether they are present in your OpenGround project. We have added in **more flexibility** to build your own dataset with the additional abilitiy to edit a dataset.

Our friends and testers have been helping us to make the final adjustments to get things just right. We have **new additional features** to make Giraphe even more useful for you, such as the ability to **filter graphs** by geology code and/or locations, saving these with the graph.

Get started with Giraphe to experience the latest cloud-based solution from Oasys. Use Giraphe to create visualisations for your own geotechnical data or use data from OpenGround.

**Report-ready graphs** with interactive features and **live data connections** are almost here! 

**Happy Holidays** to you and yours from all of us at Oasys.
